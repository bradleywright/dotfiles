Sublime Text 2 Configuration
============================

This is my configuration for the [Sublime Text editor](http://www.sublimetext.com/2).

## Installing on OS X

    rm -rf "$P/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User"
    git clone https://github.com/bradleywright/sublime-text.d.git "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User"

this has the added benefit of allowing all changes to be tracked with Git.
